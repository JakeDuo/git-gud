This practice level is designed to put to use your previously learned skills.
>>>
Let's say you were working on a project and you have some changes to newImage and caption which are stacked on top of each other in your repository. 
To complete the project we need to change newImage, despite it being a previous commit. There are several ways to do this.
One method is to first reorder the commits with rebase -i. 
Then modify the commit with commit --amend.
Next, reorder the commits to how they were previously.
Finally, move master back to the updated part of the tree.
>>>
To visualize this lets say that there are 3 commits, commit 1 "master" , commit 2 "newImage", commit 3 "caption" .
>>>
To complete this level copy the two commits with the modified newImage commit into the master branch using the above method or one of your choice. 
hint: HEAD is currently at caption
