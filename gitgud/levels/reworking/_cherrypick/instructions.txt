This practice level will familiarize with you with the command git cherry-pick.
>>>
Cherry-pick in git allows you to copy a series of commits below your current location (HEAD).
>>>
It appears in the form of "git cherry-pick <commit1> <commit2> <...>"
>>>
To use this properly, lets say we have some work in our branch that we want to copy into master. While we can accomplish this through a rebase, we can also do this through cherry-pick.
Let's say there are 3 commits in the branch: commit2, commit3, and commit4. If we want to copy commit2 and commit4 into master then we would use the command "git cherry-pick commit2 commit3".
>>>
Now lets say there are 3 branches: branch1, branch2, and branch3. branch1 contains commit2 and commit3, branch2 contains commit4 and commit5, branch3 contains commit6 and commit7.
To complete this level, copy some work commit3, commit4, and commit7 from the three branches into master.
